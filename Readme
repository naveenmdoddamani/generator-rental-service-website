How to Run:
Just 






for password resetting i have used SSL security of E-mail password ,so for using your original e-mail address to get the mail from Django
local host do the following steps:
1. Login to your Account using https://myaccount.google.com/.
2. Then go to Security option in left corner.
3. Then go to "How you sign in to Google" and Enable "Two step verification".
4. After this in the same tab scroll down till end --> select "App passwords" option and create an app password.
5. you will get a 16 digit password like this --> "drbowbrqgyhtpaeh".
6. copy the code and paste it in the settings.py file of the generator project.
7. change  "DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL" and "EMAIL_HOST_USER" mail to your mail-id and run the project
8. open after receiving the email for password resetting """""open the link in the PC which is running the local-host"""""" and the password will get change 
9. If you want to use fake E-mail the comment the code and remove comment from below two lines and it will do the same thing.



It is better to off the windows fire-wall while running the project to minimize the unknown errors




changes in settings.py file ;
change example@gmail.com from settings.py ,in admin site to your gmail with 16 digit code.  :)
